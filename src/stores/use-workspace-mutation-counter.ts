/**
 * Monotonic counter that ticks every time the agent commits a file-editor
 * mutation in the workspace and every time the user clicks Refresh in the
 * Files tab. Serves two purposes:
 *
 *   1. It's part of the {@link useWorkspaceFileContent} query key, so the
 *      hook refetches the selected file's body (used for text decoding /
 *      binary classification) after each edit or Refresh even when the
 *      selected path hasn't moved.
 *   2. It's appended as a `?v=<count>` cache-buster to the static
 *      workspace fileserver URLs used by `<iframe src>` / `<img src>` for
 *      the rich preview, so the browser re-requests a fresh copy of that
 *      top-level file after each edit or Refresh. Only the top-level URL
 *      changes: sibling assets the rendered HTML references (CSS, images)
 *      keep their own URLs and can still come from the browser cache.
 *
 * The count is seeded from `Date.now()` at page load rather than 0, so the
 * first `?v=` URL of a page load never matches one the browser cached
 * during an earlier load (the fileserver sends no Cache-Control, so a
 * reload would otherwise show the old bytes).
 *
 * Consumers:
 *   - {@link useAutoRefreshFilesOnEdit} bumps this (trailing-debounced) on
 *     each mutation batch so a burst of edits reloads the preview once.
 *   - The Files tab Refresh button bumps it so the open file refetches and
 *     the rich preview re-requests.
 *   - {@link useWorkspaceFileContent} reads the count via its query key so
 *     the hook refetches after each bump.
 *   - `FileContentViewer` / files-tab "open in new tab" link append the
 *     count to the static URL via {@link withWorkspaceCacheBuster}.
